## 💻 A little bit of code

```javascript
// A function that returns a random joke
function getRandomJoke() {
  const jokes = [
    "What do you call a fish wearing a bowtie? Sofishticated.",
    "How do you make a tissue dance? You put a little boogie in it.",
    "Why did the math book look so sad? Because of all of its problems.",
    "What do you get when you cross a snowman with a vampire? Frostbite.",
    "How do you get a squirrel to like you? Act like a nut.",
  ];
  const index = Math.floor(Math.random() * jokes.length);
  return jokes[index];
}

// A function that prints hello world with a random joke
function helloWorld() {
  console.log(`Hello world ${getRandomJoke()}`);
}

// Call the function
helloWorld();
